# Note-taker/Add goals
This is a remake of the previous note taker i built; instead of adding a note, i changed it up and made an "add goal" button instead. This list of goals  is built using React js instead of your traditional javascript. User can add a goal then double click it to remove a single item irather than clearing the entire day that was a feature in the previous application.

### Usage:
This application provides DOM specific methods that can be used at the top level of a web app to enable an efficient way of managing DOM elements of the web page. With the bar and big button users can input information that sets goals and can keep track by simply adding or deleting goals from the list. I took this approach to see if i can transfer my skills and augment an application that i had prevously made and developed it on react instead.
