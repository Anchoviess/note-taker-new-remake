# note-taker/add goals
This is a remake of the previous note taker i built; instead of adding a note, i changed it up and made an "add goal" button instead. This list of goals  is built using React js instead of your traditional javascript. User can add a goal then double click it to remove a single item irather than clearing the entire day that was a feature in the previous application.
